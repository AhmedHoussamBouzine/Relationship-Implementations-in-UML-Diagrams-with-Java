## Introduction

Understanding relationships between classes and entities is crucial in software design and modeling. UML provides a standardized way of representing these relationships visually. This repository serves as a reference to demonstrate different types of relationships in UML diagrams with clear Java examples.

## UML Relationship Types

### Inheritance (Generalization)
- Illustrates an "is-a" relationship where one class (subclass/child) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (superclass/parent).

### Composition
- Depicts a "whole-part" relationship, where one class (whole) consists of parts that cannot exist independently. The existence of the whole controls the existence of the parts.

### Association
- Represents a relationship between two classes, showing that objects of one class are related to objects of another class.

### Aggregation
- Describes a "has-a" relationship similar to composition but with a weaker association. The parts can exist independently of the whole.

### Dependency
- Shows a temporary relationship where one class depends on another class in a particular context, typically through method parameters or local variables.


## Usage
